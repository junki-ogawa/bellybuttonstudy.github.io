Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Using Plot.ly I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset from robdunnlab.com (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

When using this data please make sure to use the following 3 files: samples.json, index.html, and app.js. 
  - The samples.json file is the full sample list from robdunnlab.com
  - index.html is the html file needed with bootstrap and plot.ly scripts
  - app.js is the javascript file
